    JERUSALEM--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 31st, 2000--Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (Nasdaq: <A HREF="stock_info.asp?ticker=TEVA">TEVA</A>) today reported that net income (before
one-time charges) for the quarter ended June 30, 2000, reached $44.7
million compared with $31.1 million reported in the second quarter of
1999 (up 44%) and earnings per ADR (before a one-time charge) were
$0.33 (up 32%). 
</P>
<P>
    Total sales for the second quarter 2000 rose 51% to 444.0 million.
59% of these sales were in North America, 24% in Europe, 14% in Israel
and 3% in the rest of world.
</P>
<P>
    The one-time charge relates to the purchase of in-process R&D, in
the amount of $35.7 million, mainly due to the acquisition of
Novopharm. Including this one-time charge, net income for the quarter
totaled $9.0 million and earnings per ADR amounted to $0.06.
</P>
<P>
    The operations of Novopharm, acquired in early April 2000, were
consolidated for the first time in the reported quarter. The
operations of Copley were consolidated for the first time in Q4 of
1999, and thus were not included in the comparable quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
    Net income for the first six months of 2000 (before the one-time
charge) reached $82.6 million, up 39% from the comparable period of
1999 and earnings per ADR for the six months (before the one-time
charge), totaled $0.63, an increase of 31%. Total sales for the first
half of 2000 rose 34% to $781.3 million.
</P>
<P>
    Eli Hurvitz, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "We
are pleased with our quarterly and 6 month results - the second
quarter was complex, including the integration of Novopharm, several
generic product launches and extensive innovative R&D activities.
Nevertheless, we again exceeded market expectations."
</P>
<P>
    Total pharmaceutical sales for the second quarter which
constituted approximately 90% of Teva's total revenue, rose 63% and
reached $397.4 million.
</P>
<P>
    North America Pharmaceutical Sales reached $239.5 million, up 114%
compared to the second quarter of 1999. This increase is due mainly to
the consolidation of Novopharm and Copley but also reflects
significant sales of new products which have been launched since late
1999.
</P>
<P>
    Newly launched products include the generic versions of Voltaren
XR(R), Adalat CC(R) 30mg (both supplied by Biovail) Hytrin(R),
Cylert(R), which were launched prior to the second quarter and
Nizoral(R) 2% Cream, Betapace(R), and Actigall(R), in the second
quarter. During the 2nd quarter Teva received final approvals for the
generic version of Relafen(R) 500mg and 750mg and Nolvadex(R) 10mg
which are Paragraph IV filings. Subsequent to the end of the quarter,
Biovail received tentative approval for the generic version of
Procardia XL(R) 30mg and 60mg which will be exclusively marketed by
Teva. For the 60mg strength, Teva will have 180 days of marketing
exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
    At the end of the quarter, 50 applications were awaiting FDA final
approval including 13 tentative approvals (2 of which are Biovail's)
awaiting expiration of either patents or pediatric exclusivity. About
half were submitted under paragraph IV, thus, in some of these
products, in which Teva was the first to submit an application to the
FDA, Teva may be granted a six month exclusivity period. Total annual
sales for these 50 products, in terms of branded drugs, reach
approximately $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
    Pharmaceuticals sales in Europe in the reported quarter reached
$93.4 million, up 29%. This increase from the comparable quarter
reflects the first time consolidation of Human Serum & Pharmaceutical
Manufacturing Co. Ltd, the Hungarian subsidiary of Novopharm. Sales in
the rest of Europe increased in terms of the Euro but due to a 9%
devaluation of the Euro, sales decreased in dollar terms by 7%.
Governmental imposed price constraints, both in Hungary and the U.K,
were partially offset by sales of products launched during the first
quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
    At the end of the quarter, 139 product applications were awaiting
approval from the Regulatory Authorities in various countries in
Europe, mainly in Hungary, the U.K. and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
    Eli Hurvitz further commented: "The geographic mix of our business
serves as a balance, enabling us to maintain our overall growth rates.
We intend to pursue further opportunities for acquisitions both in
Europe and North America as the industry consolidation continues."
</P>
<P>
    Pharmaceutical sales in Israel in the reported quarter amounted to
$56.4 million, up 9% from the comparable period.
</P>
<P>
    During the second quarter of 2000, Copaxone(R) global in-market
sales reached $59.4 million, up 56% as compared with the second
quarter of 1999. About 85% of these sales were generated in the U.S.
where Copaxone(R), according to IMS, continued to strengthen its
number two position in the MS market, exceeding a 25% market share.
</P>
<P>
    Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) sales to third parties
decreased by 6% to $41.2 as compared with the second quarter of 1999.
However, that was compensated by higher margins and increased sales to
Teva's pharmaceutical units. Total API sales increased 8% and totaled
$76.6 million.
</P>
<P>
    Gross profit totaled $168.3 million and the gross profit margin
was 37.9% this quarter as compared to the 41.1% margin in the second
quarter of 1999. This decrease is almost entirely attributable to the
first time consolidation of Novopharm and its subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
    Gross Research and Development (R&D) expenses amounted to $30.1
million, an increase of 35% compared to the same period last year.
Over half of this increase is due to higher expenses in innovative R&D
(mainly Copaxone(R) and the advanced CNS projects). Net R&D expenses
(after participations) totaled $26.3 million. The increase in net R&D
expenses (24%) was at a lower rate than the increase in gross R&D due
to higher participations by strategic partners in the innovative R&D
projects. Gross R&D expenses do not include the acquisition of
in-process R&D resulting mainly from the acquisition of Novopharm
which was recorded as one-time charge in this quarter and amounted to
$35.7 million.
</P>
<P>
    Selling, General and Administration (SG&A) expenses totaled $73.1
million in the reported quarter compared to $54.8 million in the
comparable quarter last year. This increase is mainly due to the
inclusion of Copley's and Novopharm's SG&A expenses (including
amortization of goodwill resulting from their acquisition). However,
SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased from 18.6% to 16.5%.
</P>
<P>
    Financial Expenses-net, amounted to $12.2 million. This reflects
an increase of 78% from the second quarter of 1999, mainly due to
interest costs arising from the acquisitions of Copley and Novopharm.
</P>
<P>
    The Rationalization process relating to Copley's operations
continued during the second quarter of 2000 as products are gradually
being transferred from Copley's main plant in Boston to other Teva
production sites. Operations at Novopharm's North Carolina plant have
been curtailed, and Teva has began to implement a rationalization plan
for Novopharm's plants in Canada.
</P>
<P>
    Teva's Finance Committee, recommended to the Board of Directors to
declare a regular cash dividend of NIS 0.225 (approx. $ 0.055) per ADR
with respect to the second quarter of 2000. The final declaration of
the dividend and the record and payment dates is expected to be
determind at the Board meeting to be held on August 21, 2000.
